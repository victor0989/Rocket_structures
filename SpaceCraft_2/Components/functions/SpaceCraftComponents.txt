 Blender’s BMesh module to manipulate a box into a final spaceship. Here’s the basic algorithm:

Start with a box.
Build the hull: Extrude the front/rear faces several times, adding random translation/scaling/rotation along the way.
Add asymmetry to the hull: Pick random faces and extrude them out in a similar manner, reducing in scale each time.
Add detail to the hull: Categorize each face by its orientation and generate details on it such as engines, antenna, weapon turrets, lights etc.
Sometimes apply horizontal symmetry.
Add a Bevel modifier to angularize the shape a bit.
Apply materials to the final result.
Take over the universe with your new infinite fleet of spaceships.
