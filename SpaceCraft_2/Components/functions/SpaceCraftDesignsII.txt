Python designs and components of spacecraft and system propulsión VASIMIR, ION Extraction also.
Design a next-generation space vehicle inspired by the SpaceX Falcon 9, incorporating alternative fuel systems and plasma-based propulsion. The spacecraft should include a composite fuselage with high thermal and radiation shielding for operation in environments with weakened atmospheres and intense solar radiation. Integrate components like the Merlin-D engine, cold gas thrusters for satellite formation flying, and VASIMR (Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket) propulsion. Include structural documentation-style labels on the jet engine components: diffuser, compressor, combustion chamber, turbine, and nozzle. Show sensor arrays connected to FPGA-based MicroBlaze processors (Vivado/Xilinx) with VHDL-based control. Emphasize futuristic, modular engineering capable of surviving extreme natural disasters or long-term cosmic exposure, with radiator systems, ion cyclotron heating coils, and magnetic confinement fields visible. Design should be grounded in realistic aerospace engineering and include elements like thermal control systems, fuel injectors, and plasma exhaust nozzles.

The concept is to design plasma-based and alternative fuel architectures within the context of the SpaceX Falcon platform, particularly focusing on the fuselage, the Merlin-D engine, and the combustion system—structured as a technical documentation framework. This includes the potential use of advanced composites to develop next-generation spacecraft that can operate effectively under extreme conditions such as atmospheric degradation, increased radiation exposure, and planet.
