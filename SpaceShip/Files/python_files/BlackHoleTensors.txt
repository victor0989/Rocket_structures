Summary: Gravity Tensors, Black Holes, and Rocket Combustion Systems

This concept explores analogies between gravitational fields from black holes and propulsion systems in rocketry. Using weak-field approximations (φ = -GM/r) and Newtonian limits of General Relativity, spacecraft propulsion may be modeled with gravity tensor structures. Gravitational symmetry, multipole moments, and conserved quantities (P^μ, J^μν) suggest the feasibility of artificial gravity engines.

Rocket combustion systems depend on injector geometry, pressure drop, and spray atomization. Cold tests with water simulate flow behaviors before using actual propellants. Chamber dimensions directly impact cooling, thermal exchange, and combustion efficiency.

Transient startup conditions require proper design to avoid instability. Incorporating plasma technology could improve heat transfer, enhance fuel-air mixing, and stabilize flows under microgravity. Plasma may serve as a medium linking gravitational dynamics with thermochemical propulsion.

Combining plasma, structured chambers, and gravitational field analogs may lead to flexible, adaptive, and more realistic space propulsion systems.
