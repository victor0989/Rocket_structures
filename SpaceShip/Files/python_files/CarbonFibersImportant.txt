Pitch-Based Carbon Fibers

As raw materials; bituminous coal, petroleum bitumen and asphalt or polyoxyethylene asphalt
should be appropriately treated so that their rheological property, chemical composition and
structure will meet the requirements for carbonization and graphitization. Asphalt can be
isotropic or anisotropic (such as mesopitch or LCD).

Carbon fibers derived from the isotropic system generally have poor performance; for example,
their tensile strength is about 950 MPa, Young’s modulus is 40–45 GPa and the tensile strain is
2.0–2.2%. These fibers are referred to as common-class products and are mainly used in composites
that do not require high performance. Alternatively, high-performance carbon fibers, particularly
the ultra-high-modulus carbon fibers, can be manufactured from mesopitch.

Since the original carbon content of pitch is higher than that of PAN, its carbon yield is higher
after carbonation. In addition to a high Young’s modulus, pitch-based carbon fibers also have
good thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity and a negative coefficient of thermal expansion.
However, their processing properties and compressive strength are not as good as those of PAN-based
carbon fibers.

High-performance pitch-based carbon fibers have unique applications in aerospace and space satellites,
etc. The mechanical properties of some typical commercial pitch-based carbon fibers are listed below:

The Granoc XN series are low modulus, low strength carbon fibers with a fiber diameter of about 10 μm,
Young’s modulus of 55–155 GPa, tensile strength of 1.10–2.40 GPa, low density (1.65–2.80 g/cm³), and tensile
strain of 1.5–2.0%. Mainly used in civil engineering and infrastructure as sealing materials, reinforcing sheets
for repairing concrete, tunnel walls, and poles.

The Granoc CN series are carbon fibers mainly used for recreational sport supplies and general industrial applications.
Compared with T300-type PAN-based carbon fibers, their Young’s modulus is much higher and suitable for materials
requiring stiffness. Applications include electronic equipment, precision optical instruments, acoustics, audio equipment,
robot arms, and various rollers.

The Granoc YSH series of carbon fibers are mainly used in manufacturing satellite antennas, satellite structure components,
solar panels, joysticks, strings, missile components, and rocket components.

In China, research focuses on common pitch-based carbon fibers using isotropic pitch as the precursor and high-performance
pitch-based carbon fibers using mesopitch as the precursor. Common carbon fibers have tensile strength 0.80–0.95 GPa, Young’s
modulus 40–45 GPa, tensile strain 2.0–2.5%, but are not industrialized yet. Due to poor mechanical properties, they are mainly
used for functional or cement matrix composites.

High-performance pitch-based carbon fibers are prepared from mesopitch by melt spinning, pre-oxidation, carbonation, and graphitization.
Performance largely depends on precursor structure and composition. Mesopitch studies led to graphite fibers produced by modification
of oil residue and coal. Spinnable pitch softening point is 264–278 °C with mesopitch content above 95%. Typical mechanical properties
of final continuous carbon fibers are listed below.
