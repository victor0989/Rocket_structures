Calculated results:
Effective dielectric constant of the plasma (εR): 1.067×10⁰

This suggests a slight alteration in the vacuum's electromagnetic behavior due to the plasma.

Represents the proportion of the energy increase that occurs in the rotor versus the stator;
 a typical value in modern turbines.

The ion trajectory exhibits a curved spiral due to the Lorentz force.
This behavior is consistent with an E×B cross-acceleration regime,
useful for plasma-based or magnetohydrodynamic propulsion systems.
Couple with turbofan engine energy models (kinetic energy and enthalpy).
Model spin interference and Cartan curvature to include the effects of gravitational
fields or quantum rotation.

RTOS control if you wish to simulate their response in a real aircraft.

10.2.5.1 Blade Loading Coefficient (Or Temperature Drop Coefficient)
The temperature drop or blade loading coefficient is expressed as:

ψ = Cp ΔT0s / (U² / 2) = 2Ca(tanα₂ + tanα₃) / U = 2Ca(tanβ₂ + tanβ₃) / U (10.11a)

10.2.5.2 Flow Coefficient
The flow coefficient has the same definition as in the axial compressor, namely:

ϕ = Ca/U (10.12)

Combining blade loading and flow coefficients, Eq. (10.11a) becomes:

ψ = 2ϕ(tanα₂ + tanα₃) = 2ϕ(tanβ₂ + tanβ₃) (10.11b)

10.2.5.3 Degree of Reaction
The degree of reaction is defined in terms of static enthalpy change as:

Λ = (T₂ - T₃) / (T₁ - T₃)
Λ = Static enthalpy drop in rotor / Static enthalpy drop in stage

Since the relative total enthalpy at rotor inlet and outlet is equal:

h₂ + W₂² / 2 = h₃ + W₃² / 2

Then:

T₂ - T₃ = (1 / 2Cp)(W₃² - W₂²)

For equal inlet and outlet absolute speeds C₁ = C₃, thus:

ΔT = ΔT₀, ΔT_stage = ...

So the degree of reaction becomes:

Λ = (W₃² - W₂²) / (2UΔCu)

Next, since:

W₂² = C₂² + U² - 2UCu₂
W₃² = C₃² + U² - 2UCu₃

Then:

W₃² - W₂² = C₃² - C₂² + 2U(Cu₂ - Cu₃) = C₃² - C₂² + 2UΔCu

If U₂ = U₃ = U:

T₂ - T₃ = 1/2Cp [C₃² - C₂² + 2UΔCu]

Now, if Ca₂ = Ca₃:

Λ = (C₃² - C₂² + 2UΔCu) / (2UΔCu)

Then:

Λ = 1 - (C₂² / C₃²) + (UΔCu / C₃²)

Introducing:

sec²β₃ - sec²β₂ = tan²β₃ - tan²β₂
ΔT_stage = UΔCu / Cp

Then:

Λ = Ca / (UCa)(tanβ₂ + tanβ₃) * (Cp / 2U)(tan²β₃ - tan²β₂) (10.13c)

Introducing the flow coefficient:

Λ = ϕ / 2 (tan²β₃ - tan²β₂) (10.13d)

Thus, for an impulse turbine stage, with equal axial speed (Ca₂ = Ca₃):

Λ = 0, β₃ = β₂, W₂ = W₃, T₂ = T₃
