PROPELLANT INGREDIENTS

A number of relatively common propellant ingredients are listed in Table 13–6 for
double-base propellants and for composite-type solid propellants in Table 13–7.

TABLE 13–6. Typical Ingredients of Double-Base (DB) Propellants and
Composite-Modified Double-Base (CMDB) Propellants
a Several of these, but not all, are added to CMDB propellant.
