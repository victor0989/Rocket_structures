4.3 Flight Environments
The maximum predicted environments the payload will experience from liftoff through separation are described in the sections below. Falcon vehicles may be able to accommodate payloads with characteristics outside the limitations indicated in these sections and may also be able to provide environments lower than those indicated in these sections. Please contact SpaceX with your mission-unique requirements.

4.3.1 Loads
During flight, the payload will experience a range of axial and lateral accelerations. Axial acceleration is driven by vehicle thrust and drag profiles; lateral acceleration is primarily driven by wind gusts, engine gimbal maneuvers, first-stage engine shutdown and other short-duration events. Both the first- and second-stage engines may be throttled to help maintain launch vehicle and payload steady state acceleration limits



6.5. TANK PRESSURIZATION
As stated earlier, the objective of feed systems is to move propellants under pressure from propellant tanks to thrust chamber(s). The tank pressurization system is that part of the feed system that provides such a propellant expellant gas. See Refs. 6–1, 6–6, 6–7, and 6–10. As described in Section 6.3, there are two types: (1) in a pressurized gas feed system, a relatively high-pressure gas displaces the propellants from the tanks, and (2) in a pumped feed system (described in the next section) the main energy for feeding the propellants comes from one or more pumps. The latter requires lower gas pressures in the tanks to move the propellants to the pump inlet, and it helps to avoid pump cavitation.

There are several sources of pressurizing gas used in tank pressurization systems.

High-pressure inert gases stored at ambient temperature are the most common. Typical gases are helium, nitrogen, and air. Table 6–3 shows a comparison of the regulated pressure system (see Fig. 1–3) and the blow-down system (see Fig. 6–6). This is discussed further in this section. When gases expand adiabatically, their temperature drops.

Heated high-pressure inert gases (typically 200 to 800 °F or 93 to 427 °C) reduce the amount of required gas and thus the inert mass of the pressurizing system. Examples include gases heated by a heat exchanger with the warm exhaust from a gas generator or a turbine or with electrical heaters inside the gas tank.

Gases created by a chemical reaction using either liquid bipropellants or a monopropellant.

Sample the signals from significant sensors (e.g., chamber pressure, gas and hardware temperatures, tank pressure, valve position, etc.) at frequent intervals, say once, 10, 100, or 1000 times per second. For parameters that change slowly (e.g., the temperature of the control box), sampling every second or every 5 seconds may be adequate, but chamber pressure would be sampled at a high frequency.

Keep a record of all the significant signals received and all the signals generated by the computer and sent out as commands or information. Old records have at times been very important.

Control and verify the steps and sequence of the engine start. Figure 11–3, and Table 11–4 list typical steps that have to be taken, but do not list the measured parameters that will confirm that the commanded step was implemented. For example, if the igniter is activated, a signal change from a properly located temperature sensor or a radiation sensor could verify that the ignition had indeed happened.

Control the shutdown of the engine. For each of the steps listed at the bottom of Table 11–4 or in Fig. 11–3 there often has to be a sensing of a pressure change or other parameter change to verify that the commanded shutdown step was taken. An emergency shutdown may be commanded by the controller during development testing, when it senses certain kinds of malfunctions that allow the engine to be shut down safely before a dramatic failure occurs. This emergency shutdown procedure must be done quickly and safely and may be different from a normal shutdown, and must avoid creating a new hazardous condition.

Limit the duration of full thrust operation. For example, cutoff is to be initiated just before the vehicle attains the desired mission flight velocity.

Safety monitoring and control. Detect combustion instability, overtemperatures in precombustors, gas generators, or TP bearings, violent TP vibration, TP overspeed, or other parameters known to cause rapid and drastic component malfunction that can quickly lead to engine failure. Usually, more than one sensor signal will show such a malfunction. If detected by several sensors, the computer may identify it as a possible failure whose in-flight remedy is well known (and preprogrammed into the computer); then a corrective action or a safe shutdown may be automatically commanded by the control computer. This applies mostly to development engines during ground tests.

Analyze key sensor signals for deviation from nominal performance before, during, and after engine operation. Determine whether sensed quantities are outside of predicted limits. If appropriate and feasible, if more than one sensor indicates a possible out-of-limit value, and if the cause and remedy can be predicted (preprogrammed), then the computer can automatically initiate a compensating action. Parts of or combinations of items 6 and 7 have been called engine health monitoring systems. They are discussed in Section 11.5.

Control propellant tank pressurization. The tank pressure value has to be within an allowable range during engine operation and also during a coasting flight period prior to a restart. Sensing the activation of relief valves on the tank confirms overpressure. Automatically, the computer can then command stopping or reducing the flow of pressurant.

Perform automatic closed-loop control of thrust and propellant utilization (described before).

Transmit signals to a flying vehicle’s telemetering system, which in turn can send them to a ground station, thus providing information on the engine status, particularly during experimental or initial flights.

Self-test the computer and software.
