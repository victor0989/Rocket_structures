Merlin 1A
The Merlin 1A was the initial SpaceX engine version, featuring an ablatively cooled carbon-fiber composite nozzle and producing 340 kN thrust. It flew twice: once in 2006 (failed due to fuel leak) and in 2007 (successful). Its turbopump, designed by Barber-Nichols, used a unique friction-welded shaft, Inconel ends, and an aluminum impeller, with a turbine running up to 20,000 rpm.

Merlin 1B
An upgraded Merlin 1A with enhanced turbopump power (1,900 kW vs. 1,500 kW) through full admission turbine and larger impellers. It was designed for Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 with higher thrust (380 kN sea level, 420 kN vacuum) and pyrophoric ignition. Merlin 1B was never flown, replaced by the regeneratively cooled Merlin 1C.

Merlin 1C
A regeneratively cooled engine used in Falcon 1 and Falcon 9. It produces 420 kN at sea level and 480 kN in vacuum, with high specific impulse (~275 s sea level, 305 s vacuum), chamber pressure ~6.77 MPa, and a thrust-to-weight ratio of 96. It weighs 630 kg and is 2.92 m long.

Black Hole & Scalar Field Collapse (Theoretical)
- Studies of spacetime structure near black holes formed by scalar field collapse.
- Critical collapse shows different global spacetime limits depending on parameters.
- Numerical simulations use characteristic coordinates tracking light rays.
- Equations describe scalar field dynamics and metric evolution in spherical symmetry.
