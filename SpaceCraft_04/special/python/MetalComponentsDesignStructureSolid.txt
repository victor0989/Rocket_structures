Metal Layer and Major Component Design: Structural Design of the MSX Optical Bench
Materials and Construction:

The gusset plates and the optical bench were constructed with multiple layers of unidirectional tape in a pseudoisotropic stack (0°, 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 150°) (S_N).
Rib core: 12 layers; outer layers: 24 layers.
Material properties of P75S/ERL1962 are shown in Table 5 (tensile, modulus, Poisson, compressive strength, CTE, etc.).

An indium tin moisture barrier was applied to protect structural stability and minimize moisture contamination of the optical sensors.
Kinematic Mounting System:
Mounted with spherical supports providing non-redundant translational support in 1, 2, and 3 directions for three mounting points.
The mounts are fixed in the center plane of the bench thickness to limit moment transfer and reduce deformations.
Mounts are made of titanium due to its low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and low thermal conductivity, thermally isolating the optical bench from the instrument section.

Thermal and Mechanical Requirements:
Must withstand extreme temperatures from -240°C to +60°C.
Quasistatic load resistance: 212.5 g/+6.5 g in the thrust direction (x), ±6.5 g in the lateral directions (y, z).
Restrictions on component attachments and lifting points to ensure integrity.
Stiffness frequency requirement: minimum 100 Hz to avoid dynamic couplings.

Maximum system mass: 6.8 kg.
Analysis and Testing:
A finite element model (FEM) was used to analyze loads, natural frequencies, and deformations.
Fundamental dynamic frequencies: 111 Hz (bending in the thrust direction), 138 Hz (torsion of the stellar chamber plane), 203 Hz (lateral bending).
Sufficient structural safety margin in most areas; moderate stress levels under load.
The maximum operational thermal deformation was 1.65 arcsec, including the effects of the lift-off torque on the kinematic mounts (torque limited to minimize impact).
Thermal analysis showed an average distortion of 2.48 arcsec/°C, slightly higher than the target of 2 arcsec/°C but acceptable for scientific purposes.

Physical Testing:
Thermal cycling between -240°C and +60°C confirmed the integrity of the adhesive bonds.
Static load testing with a safety factor of 1.25 showed that the structure withstands damage.
Pre- and post-static load modal measurements indicated natural frequencies within the expected range (~370 Hz adjusted).
Additional ±1 g testing to assess structural changes under ground/orbit conditions.
Beacon Receiver Bench
Objectives and requirements:

Cooperative target acquisition with an initial uncertainty of ±5° and tracking with a residual error of ±0.1° rms for 5 years in orbit.
The structure must not contribute more than 0.5° to the initial error and must maintain stability of ±0.03° for four antennas.
Must operate in a thermal range of -65°C to +15°C and withstand thermal gradients up to 30°C.
Fundamental frequency between 50 and 65 Hz to avoid dynamic coupling with the primary structure.
Minimize long-term creep deformations under a preload of 362.8 kg.

Structure and Materials:
G/E composite bench similar to the optical bench, with pseudoisotropic composite sheets and ribs (0°, 36°, 72°, 108°, 144°).
Titanium threaded fittings for bolted connections.
Indium tin metal barrier applied for dimensional stability against moisture.
Hinge Design and Deployment System:
Non-magnetic deployment hinge with beryllium copper torsion springs, titanium brackets and shafts, bronze bushings, and stainless steel dampers.
Functions like an "old-fashioned saloon door": initially deploys and positions the bench within ±0.5° and maintains ±0.01°.
Torsion dampers prevent overshoot, absorbing kinetic energy and ensuring correct positioning.
Compensation for differences in CTE between the composite and aluminum instrument housings is provided through internal hinge clearances.
Launch preload of 362.8 kg secured with a strain-gauge beryllium copper pin.
The release system uses a pyrotechnic firing pin to trigger pin retraction and enable deployment.
