Core Features
Central Magnetar with Spiral Torsion Fields:
At the heart lies a colossal magnetar whose torsional gravitational fields spiral outward, emitting curved, translucent plasma jets that twist through warped spacetime.

Penrose-Hole Structure:
Nearby space is warped by a Penrose-Hole — a structure acting as an inverse black hole that distorts spacetime with triangular gravitational lensing patterns, creating multi-layered visual anomalies.

Ion Stars Cluster:
Several ion stars emit glowing hues of blue, purple, and green. These include:

Magnetar Ions: Dense plasma cores generating vectorial gravito-quantum fields.

Anionic Stars: Emit reversed gravitational ripples, creating zones of negative gravity and entropy.

Binary Torsional Propulsion Trails:
Spacecraft float around the stars, propelled by linked binary torsional drives that leave intricate braided ion trails, bending through fractal folds in spacetime.

Layered Fractal Spacetime Folds:
The entire scene is overlaid by multi-layered fractal folds of spacetime, causing ripple effects in the surrounding multicolored nebulae and non-linear distance metrics.

Temporal Discontinuity Zones:
Fragmented bubbles of distorted light appear sporadically, marking regions where time flows asymmetrically or reversibly — a signature of local entropy inversion.

Alien Structures on Energy Filaments:
Hovering near energy filaments, alien megastructures draw power from entropy-negative zones, anchored within the warped spatial layers.
